        <h2>Generation neXt</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The adolescent years has been viewed, for centuries, as risky. The magnitude of the present-day problems is more severe than that reported in centuries past. A broad profile of adolescent problems would be in the areas of delinquency, drug use, academic failure, risky sexual behaviour, and emotional problems.
		<br/><br/>
		The adolescent years are the most traumatic phase of our lives. All of us have a deep longing for acceptance (i.e. to know we are loved), security (i.e. to feel safe and know we are taken care of), and significance (i.e. to desperately yearn for importance and meaning in life). The basic philosophy of the World War II Generation and the Baby Boomer generation goes something like this: You will be happy if you are good looking, perform well in school, sports or other activities, and get a nice job and engage in religious activity.
		<br/><br/>
		However, most of the Generation neXt are not buying it! The Generation NeXt adolescents entering the school, college and corporate campus today, are truly the first post-modern generation, raised in a different social environment, having different formative experiences, and different characteristics and expectations than any previous generation. Generation neXt is growing-up in an explosion of new technology …with cell phones, text messaging, e-mail and instant messaging, all making it easier for everyone to stay in constant contact with friends and family. 
		<br/><br/>
		But the sad fact is that you see little hope for lasting meaning in life. This prompts you to go on a frenzied search for excitement and fulfilment – in music, movies, video and computer games, alcohol, drugs, sex, crime and other risk-taking activities. In reality, it is all a cry for freedom. Freedom to do what you want!!?
		<br/><br/>
		Today the word freedom is defined as “being able to do what you want, when you want, and how you want, without anyone telling you otherwise.” That isn’t really true. Real freedom is getting delivered from destructive relationships and unhealthy habits. We at Care4Campus are concerned about you. We want you to recognize the hazards that loom around you secretly and experience real freedom to become the person you are created to be.
