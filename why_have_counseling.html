        <h2>Why have counseling?</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
		<b>Adolescents and Counseling:</b>
		<br/><br/>
		You need counseling for different reasons. A particular event may have caused distress or there could be something that has been going on for some time, which has robbed you of your peace and joy. Some examples of the sorts of things students come and talk about are: relationships (with friends, partners or family); self-harm; eating disorders; study problems; loneliness; depression; self-confidence; sexuality; bereavement; cultural issues and self-esteem.
		<br/><br/>
		There is also wide variation in the degree of distress you experience when you come for counseling. Some are aware that something is troubling them, although they’re not experiencing too much difficulty, whereas others are extremely distressed. Whatever the nature of your situation, you may find counseling to be of great help.
		<br/><br/>
		The Care4Campus has a core staff team of trained counselors, who have been working with adolescents experiencing a wide variety of difficulties. We can also signpost you to other professionals and organizations where appropriate.
		<br/><br/>
		<b>Recovery Methods:</b>
		<br/><br/>
		Care4Campus offers only non-medical approach. We use recovery methods such as prayer, moral guidance, spiritual counseling, scriptural studies, and belief that come from the truth of God’s Word. As a ministry to hurting people, we recognize the complexity of humans as physical and spiritual beings. “Where there is no guidance the people fall, but in abundance of counselors there is victory.” Proverbs 11:14. (NASB)
		<br/><br/>
		<b>Getting Unstuck:</b>
		<br/><br/>
		The counselling, that Care4Campus provides, is built on a triadic relationship (i.e. a group of three persons). It is an encounter with the living Christ, facilitated by a helper/counsellor who assists this redemptive and restorative process, helping you get unstuck and moving forward on the path to spiritual maturity and psycho-social-emotional good health. It is a life-on-life relationship. We can help you process the situation, the feelings, the thoughts and the goals associated with the problems and with God’s help bring clarity and closure to the issues you are dealing with.
		<br/><br/>
		<b>Care4Campus Teams:</b>
		<br/><br/>
		Care4Campus reaches out to adolescents by staying small. Once a campus team grows big, it launches new team members in a new location. So in essence Care4Campus are teams which share a common vision and approach but with no central headquarters or central authority.
		<br/><br/>
		<b>Confidentiality and Client Records:</b>
		<br/><br/>
		Care4Campus will not use or disclose any personal information or any sensitive confidential information, without your explicit consent. However, there are certain circumstances where a Care4Campus may feel it necessary or be bound by law to break confidentiality, liaising with appropriate persons and/or organizations outside our Service. Such circumstances usually relate to a concern for your own or others’ wellbeing and usually the counselor would attempt to discuss the situation with you before taking any action.
		<br/><br/>
		You will usually have the right to see the information the Counseling Service holds about you. Please note, that in certain circumstances, Care4Campus has a right to restrict your access to certain information.
		<br/><br/>
		Any information that Care4Campus holds about you will be destroyed four months after the date you last attended counseling here.
		<br/><br/>
		<b>Accessibility:</b>
		<br/><br/>
		We hope that any student will be able to access our Service and receive an appropriate level of support and that no adolescent will feel excluded from doing so, in relation to their ethnic or cultural background, gender, age, social class, religious belief, physical ability, sexual orientation, etc. If you do experience any barriers to accessing the Service, we would encourage you to let us know.
		<br/><br/>
		<b>Compliments, Complaints and Suggestions:</b>
		<br/><br/>
		We aim to offer services of high quality and hope that your experience is a positive and helpful one. However, we recognize that unfortunately this may not always be the case and we are keen to make improvements wherever possible. We would therefore value your feedback about any aspect of our Services and encourage you to contact us, whether it is in the form of a compliment, complaint or suggestion.
		<br/><br/>
		We will respond to any feedback we receive by considering the issue(s) involved and implementing any changes that will improve the Service, where appropriate and where possible. Although we will give serious consideration to all the feedback we receive, it may not be always possible to let you know the outcome of any suggestions you make.
