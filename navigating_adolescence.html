        <h2>Navigating Adolescence</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
		Adolescence is certainly the most difficult part of growing up. This ten-year period (from the age of 13 to 23), is a journey full of surprises and risks. Adolescence is a time of change - physical, emotional, mental, and social. But unfortunately, temptations to drink, take drugs and engage in early experimentation with sex arise long before you have developed skills to cope with these forces that come from every direction.  Most of you think, “I’m not as bad as the worst adolescents I know, but I’m probably not as good as I could be!” This might place you somewhere in the middle-of-the-road.
		<br/><br/>
		<b>Middle-of-the-road:</b>
		<br/><br/>
		It is during early adolescence that you begin to travel on the middle-of-the-road. This risky journey that rises at puberty continues throughout adolescence and then soars into early adulthood. This means that the prevention efforts must begin at the early-adolescent level.
		<br/><br/>
		<b>Most risky years:</b>
		<br/><br/>
		Many social scientists believe that a basic lack of control and awareness during adolescence leads to the high risk profile. Though the frequency and the intensity of these problems differ, both high and low risk groups peak in deviant behaviour during late adolescence and early adulthood. Because of this pattern of increased risk, prevention efforts should focus on all youth during the adolescent years.
		<br/><br/>
		<b>Prevention or Recovery:</b>
		<br/><br/>
		The challenge before Care4Campus is to intervene early with new preventive programs for those at lower risks, as well as channel all available resources to those at greatest risk. We are set on screening and assessing your risk status and help you access services appropriately matched to your risk level. The strategy that Care4Campus uses assures the availability of appropriate programs for every level of emerging problem. With this approach, the low risk population, who demonstrate an inclination towards deviant behavior during adolescence, are served as readily as the high risk group who are actively involved in deviant acts. This requires an early screening and assessment of your life.
		<br/><br/>
		Taking this simple and brief screening measure will quickly help you identify the broad range of problems and its risk factors. And this will help you take necessary steps, right now, to decrease or eliminate the risks. 
		<br/><br/><br/>
		1)	Have you broken rules for no reason?
		<br/><br/>
		<input type="radio" name="item1"/>&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;<input type="radio" name="item1"/>&nbsp;No
		<br/><br/><br/>
		2)	Have you felt lonely, worthless, helpless, depressed, anxious or sad in a repeated, continuous or extreme manner
		<br/><br/>
		<input type="radio" name="item2"/>&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;<input type="radio" name="item2"/>&nbsp;No
		<br/><br/><br/>
		3)	Has your sexual behaviour caused you to seek help or feel scared – getting alienated from people? Have you led a double life, keeping your sexual or romantic activities a secret from those important to you?
		<br/><br/>
		<input type="radio" name="item3"/>&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;<input type="radio" name="item3"/>&nbsp;No
		<br/><br/>
		<i>This brief and broad assessment of your behaviors will help us direct you to a source of help.</i>
